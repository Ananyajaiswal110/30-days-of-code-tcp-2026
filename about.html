            <h2>My Journey and Achievements</h2>

            <p>
                I began my journey into web development by participating in online coding bootcamps and building small, structured personal projects. My focus initially centered on mastering the foundational elements of HTML5, ensuring all my markup is semantic and follows best practices for accessibility.
